#### How to Succeed

1. Use CSS Flexbox or Grid to layout the elements on the page.

2. Use JavaScript to add event listeners to the toggle switches and delete button.

3. Use localStorage to save and load the state of the toggle switches.

4. If "delete" is clicked, clear localStorage and set all toggle switches to the off position.


Extra Challenges:

1. Add another setting to toggle a dark mode and create the styles to go with it.

2. If "delete" is clicked, have the user double down and confirm they truly want to delete their account. This could be a modal popup or it could be an input field that requires them to type in delete to confirm. Then a success message pops up and the settings menu is cleared. 

3. Have a 'create an account' view show in the menu if account was deleted.
